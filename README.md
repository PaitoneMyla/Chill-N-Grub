Chill N Grub Process 
First, the waiter is one of the authorized personel that can access the system, every position has their own task and is limited only to see some sections of the system like for the waiter, he only can access the part of the system where he will lead the customer to their table using a QR code that will be scanned by the customers using their mobile devices that will direct them to the website on which they now can scan and order menus and using the QR code, it is to identify their specific number of table where they will sit and for the admin to know where orders came from. The accountant is only allowed to access the sections of financial transactions of the restaurant such as viewing and monitoring of sales of the day and managing the bills of the customers to be paid and the accountant will also be the one to set the status of the table using a button, if the customer is already paid then the status of the table will be available. The admin is the one who's main authorized person that has full access to the system, such as adding, deleting and updating of the menu, category and tables, viewing of sales and orders, adding new users accounts.
